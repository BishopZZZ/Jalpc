## Cloud Computing

### The Most Common Cloud Models
  
- Deployment Models
  - Private
    - Control, secure, consolidation of resources
    - Utility challange, management overhead(超支)

  - Public
    - Utility computing, Can focus on core business, cost-effective
    - Security proble, loss of control, possible lock-in
  
  - Hybrid
    - use privae cloud, but burst into public cloud when needed
    - how to move data?, how to decide which data to be public?

- Delivery(交付) Models
  - Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - Gmail, office 365...
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - Google App Engine, Amazon Elastic MapReduce
  - Infrastructure(底部结构) as a Service (IaaS) (primary focus of this course)
    - AWS, Orical Public Cloud, Nectar...  

### SoA (Service-oriented Architectures)  

- When components are distributed, they have to interact in more loosely-coupled ways instead communicate directly.

SoA Design Principles：

- Service loose coupling
- Service abstraction
- Service reusability
- Service autonomy
- Service statelessness
- Service discoverablity
- Service composability
- Service granularity
- Service normalization
- Service optimization
- Service relevance
- Service encapsulation
- Service location transparency

### SOAP vs ReST

- Two patterns to call services over HTTP
- SOAP WS is built upon the **Remote Procedure Call** paradigm
- 过程远程调用(RPC): 是一个计算机通信协议。该协议允许运行于一台计算机的程序调用另一台计算机的子程序，而程序员无需额外地为这个交互作用编程。
- ReST is centered around resources, and the way they can be manipulated remotely.
- Actually **ReST is more of a style** to use HTTP than a separate protocol
- **SOAP is a stack of protocols** that covers every aspect of using a remote service, from service discovery, to service description, to the actual request/response

### Containerisation

- Similar concept of resource **isolation** and **allocation** as a VM
- Without bundling the entire hardware env. and full OS
- Containerization allows **virtual instances** to share a single host OS to reduce these wasted resources (drivers, binaries, libraries), since each container only holds the application and related binaries. The rest are shared among the containers.
- Virtualization vs Containerization  

    Virtualization | Containerization
    :---- | :---
    Run on virtual hardware, have own OS kernels | Share same OS kernel
    Communication through Ethernet devices | IPC mechanisms (pipes, sockets)
    Security depends on hypervisor | Security requires close scrutiny (监视)
    A bit slow performance | near native performance
    File systems and libraries are not shared | File systems can be shared, libraries are shared
    Slow startup time | fast startup time
    Large storage | Small storage

### CouchDB

NoSQL

- Traditional RDBMS are good at consistency, but the data are normalized, which is no longer granted for big data.
- Alternative query languages for distributed DB, not only SQL - NoSQL DBMS
- Key-Value store
  - allows the retrieval of a chunk of data given a key, fast, but crude
- BigTable DMBS
  - stores data in columns grouped into column families
- Doc-oriented DBMS
  - stores data as structured docs, like XML or JSON (like CouchDB, MongoDB)

Sharding and Replication

- Sharding: partitioning the DB horizontally.
- Replication: Action of storing the same row (or doc) on different nodes to make DB fault-tolerant.

CouchDB Features

- Doc-oriented DMBS
- HTTP ReST API
- Web-based admin interface
- Web-ready
- Supports MapReduce (with JS)
- Supports Mango queries (JSON)
- Supports replication, sharding, clusters
- CouchDB Views: Views are fast and store aggregated data, but are inflexible and use a lot of storage
