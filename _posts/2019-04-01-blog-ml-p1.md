## Machine Learning Basics

### **Supervised Learning**

Teach the computer how to do something (by example), then let it use its new-found knowledge to do it
Labeled data: for given inputs, provide the expected output (“the answer”)
Infer a function mapping from inputs to outputs

***

### **Unsupervised learning **

Let the computer learn how to do something
Determine structure and patterns in data Unlabeled data: Don’t give the computer “the answer”

***

### **How to evaluate the classifier**

Precision: Proportion of positive predictions that are correct.
Recall: Accuracy with respect to positive cases.
F1-score:   2(P*R)/(P+R)

***

### **Evaluation Strategies**

#### Leave one out

Let us assume we have N data points for which we know the labels. We choose each data point as test case and the rest as training data. This means we have to train the system N times and the average performance is computed across the N predictions

***

#### M-fold Cross-Validation

Let us assume we have N data points for which we know the labels. We partition the data into M (approximately) equal size partitions. We choose each partition for testing and the remaining M-1 partitions for training  
This means we have to train the system M times and the average performance is computed across the M runs.
